This is an R package to randomly generate graphs with fixed marginals through 
sequential importance sampling.  The algorithm used is that described in 
Chen, Diaconis, Holmes, and Liu (2005).  This package is intended to be used with the
'statnet' suite of packages (Handcock, Hunter, Butts, Goodreau, and Morris 2008).
